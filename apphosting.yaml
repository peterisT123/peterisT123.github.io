# Settings to manage and configure a Firebase App Hosting backend.

runConfig:
  # Increase this value if you'd like to automatically spin up
  # more instances in response to increased traffic.
  maxInstances: 10
  # Secret environment variables, prefixed with 'SECRET_'.
  # Pass these to your app as environment variables.
  secretEnv:
    - secret: GMAIL_USER
      env: GMAIL_USER
    - secret: GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD
      env: GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD

# In order for your App Hosting backend to be able to access secrets from
# Secret Manager, you must grant the App Hosting service account the
# "Secret Manager Secret Accessor" role.
#
# The service account is:
# firebase-app-hosting-run-sa@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com
#
# You can do this in the Google Cloud console:
# https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam
#
# Or with the gcloud CLI:
# gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding <PROJECT_ID> --member='serviceAccount:firebase-app-hosting-run-sa@<PROJECT_ID>.iam.gserviceaccount.com' --role='roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor'
